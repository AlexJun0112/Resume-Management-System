       " Summary I have two decades of data intensive computing experience. I am passionate about applying data strategy together with business driven technology to solve industrial problems.  I have a strong record of success in leading, managing and delivering top tier innovative technology to align and achieve organisation needs and goals. I am currently the Head of Data Science and Analytics at Central Bank of Malaysia where I lead a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers responsible to provide advance analytics in the Bank.  Prior to the Bank,  I worked at MIMOS Berhad, Malaysia's national Applied R&amp;D institute, where I led data vision and products roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, Data-intensive analytics, and Cloud IaaS &amp; PaaS technologies.   My early work experiences was in computational science and High Performance Computing (HPC) system runtime software and architecture at a prestigious US national laboratory to support groundbreaking scientific discoveries.   I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UK and B.S and M.S in Computer Science from US.

For storage area, our work focus on data protection and availability, long-term data preservation, and storage optimization.  As for Â  Page 2 of 4 Â  Â  network virtualization, we focus on cloud-based network policy and security. Since 2012, we have developed and deployed our cloud and storage platforms to public and private sectors.  ATL investigates the use of Accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for industrial and scientific applications. We applied the state-of-the-art of parallel computational algorithms and implemented them as libraries, interfaces, or accelerative components. Since 2012, ATL has developed and deployed to industries including GPU Graph/Text Analytics, GPU Image Processing for Multi-Video Analytic, GPU SQL query Accelerator, and GPU Accelerated Library (Mi- AccLib).  AIL focuses on Artificial Intelligence technology to develop high performance Intelligent Big Data Analytics.
