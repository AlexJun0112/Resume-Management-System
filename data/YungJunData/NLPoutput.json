ACL is recognized as particularly strong in the areas of system software and architecture. We investigate these areas in the context of emerging computing paradigms such as cloud computing, mobile computing, data- intensive computing, and edge computing, and explore their utilisation in supporting enterprise applications. Currently focusing on using lean virtualisation technologies to manage Internet-of-Things (loTs) applications at the network edge. For storage area, our work focus on data protection and availability, long-term data preservation, and storage optimization. As for Page 2 of 4 network virtualization, we focus on cloud-based network policy and security. Since 2012, we have developed and deployed our cloud and storage platforms to public and private sectors. ATL investigates the use of Accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for industrial and scientific applications. We applied the state-of-the-art of parallel computational algorithms and implemented them as libraries, interfaces, or accelerative components. Since 2012, ATL has developed and deployed to industries including GPU Graph/Text Analytics, GPU Image Processing for Multi-Video Analytic, GPU SQL query Accelerator, and GPU Accelerated Library (Mi- AccLib). AIL focuses on Artificial Intelligence technology to develop high performance Intelligent Big Data Analytics. The R&D team applies Data Science and Knowledge Science technologies like Machine Learning, Semantic Technology, large scale Graph Analytics, and Natural Language Processing for deriving insights from the unstructured and structured data. We have been applied the technology to Domain Knowledge Management, Enterprise Performance Management, Online Analytical Processing, Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics.
